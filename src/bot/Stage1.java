* Description
Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot which will help you to study programming.

For the first stage, you will write a bot who displays a greeting, its name and the date of its creation.

Your program must print the following lines:

Hello! My name is {botName}.
I was created in {birthYear}.
Instead of {botName} print any name you choose and replace {birthYear} with the current year (four digits), ex:

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2018.
You can change the text if you need but print exactly two lines.

Next, we will use Aid and 2018 as your assistant's name and its birth year, but you can change it if you want*/

package bot;

public class Stage1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
